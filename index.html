                <p>
                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building
                    user
                    interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual
                    developers
                    and companies.
                </p>
                <p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
                    applications,
                    as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded.
                    However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page,
                    which is
                    why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries
                    for
                    state management, routing, and interaction with an API: Redux, React
                    Router
                    and axios are examples of such libraries.</p>

                    The Greeter class is a React component that accepts a property greeting. The
                    ReactDOM.render method creates an instance of the Greeter component, sets the
                    greeting property to 'Hello World' and inserts the rendered component as a child
                    element to the DOM element with id myReactApp.

                    <li><strong>Components</strong>
                        <p> React code is made of entities called components. Components can be
                            rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library.
                            When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as
                            "props":
                            <blockquote>
                                <pre> <code> ReactDOM.render(
                                <Greeter greeting="Hello World!" />,document.getElementById('myReactApp')); </code></pre>
                            </blockquote>

                            The two primary ways of declaring components in React is via
                            functional
                            components and class-based components. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Functional components</strong>
                        <p>Functional components are declared with a function that then returns some
                            JSX. </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <pre> <code>function Greeting(props) {
                                            return &lt;div&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/div&gt;;} </code></pre>
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Class-based components</strong>
                        <p>Class-based components are declared using ES6 classes. They are also
                            known as "stateful" components, because their state can hold values
                            throughout the component and can be passed to child components through
                            props: </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <pre> <code> class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
                                            state = { color: 'green' };
                                            render() {
                                              return (
                                                &lt;ChildComponent color={this.state.color} /&gt; ); } </code></pre>
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>JSX</strong>
                        <p>JSX, or JavaScript XML , is an extension to the JavaScript language
                            syntax.Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to
                            structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers.
                            React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not
                            have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is
                            similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP called
                            XHP.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nested elements</strong>
                        <p>Multiple elements on the same level need to be wrapped in a single
                            container element such as the &lt;div&gt; element shown above, or
                            returned as
                            an array. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript expressions</strong>
                        <p> JavaScript expressions (but not statements) can be used inside JSX with
                            curly brackets {}: </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <pre> <code> &lt;h1&gt;{10+1}/&lt;h1&gt; </code></pre>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> The example above will render </p>
                        <pre> <code> &lt;h1&gt;11/&lt;h1&gt; </code></pre>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>React Hooks</strong>
                        <p>Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" React state and
                            lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside
                            classes — they let you use React without classes.[21]

                            React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create
                            your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.

                <p>React does not attempt to provide a complete "application framework". It is
                    designed specifically for building user interfaces and therefore does not
                    include many of the tools some developers might consider necessary to build an
                    application. This allows the choice of whichever libraries the developer prefers
                    to accomplish tasks such as performing network access or local data storage.
                    Common patterns of usage have emerged as the library matures. </p>
                <p>A React component under the Flux architecture should not directly modify any
                    props passed to it, but should be passed callback functions that create actions
                    which are sent by the dispatcher to modify the store. The action is an object
                    whose responsibility is to describe what has taken place: for example, an action
                    describing one user "following" another might contain a user id, a target user
                    id, and the type USER_FOLLOWED_ANOTHER_USER. The stores, which can be
                    thought of as models, can alter themselves in response to actions received from
                    the dispatcher. </p>
                <p>This pattern is sometimes expressed as "properties flow down, actions flow up".
                    Many implementations of Flux have been created since its inception, perhaps the
                    most well-known being Redux, which features a single store, often called a
                    single source of truth.</p>

                    major changes to React go through the Future of React repository issues and pull

                <p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released
                    an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an
                    HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed
                    in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in
                    May 2013.</p>
                <p>React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React,
                    was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in
                    March 2015. </p>
                <p>On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React
                    framework library for building user interfaces. React Fiber was to become
                    the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React
                    framework.</p>
                <p>On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.</p>
